              Drawn to simple, classic lines of the modern farmhouse design,
              blending this with the comfort of a country aesthetic. I love to
              incorporate a touch of personality in every design.

              Iâ€™m Bethany, over recent years I have been exploring what
              motivates and brings me happiness. I kept coming back to the same

              Following 4 years studying Events Management at Sheffield
              University, I have spent the last 10 years working in the
              hospitality and event sector. With a passion for creating an
              experience and happiness, I am now taking those years of
              experience and joining this with my long-time passion of design. I
              am currently studying Interior Design with the National Design
              Academy and am looking to start my own business in the near
              future.
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
              My personal inspirations have come from the experiences I have
              lived and the place i travel, in particular my time in the United
              States. My personal design style lends towards neutral palettes,
              an abundance of textures and classic lines. However, I love to
              work with your close memories and interests to create a beautiful
              and meaningful design that you will love.
